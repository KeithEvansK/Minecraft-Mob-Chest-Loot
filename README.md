## How Mob Chest Loot Works

This plugin combines all dropped loot from enemies into a single entity chest. 

Then provides a clean user interface for the player to select loot they want to take and throw away loot they may not want.

Features Include: 
 - Player specific loot. The plugin will remember what player the loot belongs to and lock it from other players or until a specific amount of time has passed.
 - Less stress on your server because it won't need to render several dropped item entities at any given time.
 - Allows use for if you want players dropped loot to also be locked into chests.
 - Clean user interface for players to navigate and select their loot.
 - Automatic cleanup. Normally if a player doesn't want their loot it stays for several minutes. Now once checked, the unwanted loot is instantly removed from the game. 

## Regular Minecraft Looting

In Minecraft, all loot is generally dropped onto the ground when an enemy is killed. 

This can cause confusion among multiple members, allows your items to be stolen by other players, and causes unecessary load on the server to maintain all dropped entities at a given time.
